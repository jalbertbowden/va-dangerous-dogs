Commonwealth of Virginia Dangerous Dogs Listings data.....via https://dd.va-vdacs.com/public/public.cgi, reference http://vdacs.virginia.gov/animals/dogs.shtml . Wow this is one of the worst government solutions yet....Ok so all this data has been copy/pasted manually....I'll work on a tool or something to automate it, but the results return to the same url....I have no idea how to trigger that search/target url for results. Right now, just .html data...Intend to convert to .json, .csv, and .xlsx @ least. Back to updates...not sure to do this monthly or semi-annually....will check back on 2014-02-30 for changes; if there are none, I'll go with semi-annually.

Known errors (there are pictures attached):
1. albemarle county has city of charlottesville data.
2. city of charlottesville data isn't the same as the data albemarle county has for cville.
3. clarke county has data from paris, va, which is in fauquier county.
