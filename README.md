Commonwealth of Virginia Dangerous Dogs Listings data.....via https://dd.va-vdacs.com/public/public.cgi, reference http://vdacs.virginia.gov/animals/dogs.shtml . Wow this is one of the worst government solutions yet....Ok so all this data has been copy/pasted manually....I'll work on a tool or something to automate it, but the results return to the same url....I have no idea how to trigger that search/target url for results. Right now, just .html data...Intend to convert to .json, .csv, and .xlsx @ least. Back to updates...not sure to do this monthly or semi-annually....will check back on 2014-02-30 for changes; if there are none, I'll go with semi-annually.
